IAM- aunthentication and authorization
basic question: what access is needed to whom?


[GRUP]
*Users
*Groups
*Roles
*Policies

whenver you create a user, attach them with some policy
create a group, add users to group (eg: db admin, devlelopers etc)
create a user and add them inside the group 
Roles-> assign the roles to a service/user who are outside or on a temporary basis
